  "content": "# Neural Networks: An Introduction\n\nNeural networks are computational models inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. These artificial networks consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized in layers.\n\n## Architecture\n\nA typical neural network has three types of layers:\n- **Input layer**: Receives the initial data\n- **Hidden layer(s)**: Process the data through weighted connections\n- **Output layer**: Produces the final result\n\n## Learning Process\n\nEach connection between neurons has an associated weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The network learns by:\n1. Processing training examples\n2. Comparing outputs to expected results\n3. Adjusting weights to minimize errors\n4. Repeating until performance is satisfactory\n\n## Applications\n\nNeural networks excel at recognizing complex patterns in data, making them valuable for:\n- Image recognition\n- Natural language processing\n- Predictive analytics\n- Autonomous systems\n\nThrough training on large datasets, neural networks can learn to perform tasks that would be extremely difficult to program explicitly.",
