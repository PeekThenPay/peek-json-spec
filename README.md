# Peek-Then-Pay JSON Specification

**Open standard bridging the AI-publisher divide ‚Äî beyond scraping vs. paywalls to collaborative
value creation**

## Overview

**The AI ecosystem is at a crossroads.** Publishers want to protect and monetize their content,
while AI systems need contextual, real-time data. This tension has created a patchwork of paywalls,
lawsuits, and closed-door deals.

Peek-Then-Pay provides a better path: an **open standard for balanced collaboration**. Just as HTTP,
HTML, and robots.txt enabled the web to thrive through shared standards, we need consistent rules
for AI content access.

### The Problem: Two Failing Extremes

Current approaches reduce to **binary extremes** that fail both sides:

- **Free scraping** ignores publisher rights and creates legal conflict
- **Hard paywalls** block discovery and kill AI integration incentives
- **Over-centralized tollbooths** concentrate power and limit publisher choice
- **Ad-hoc licensing deals** create fragmentation and don't scale

### The Solution: Balanced Hybrid Model

**Peek-Then-Pay combines the best of both approaches** with clear separation of concerns:

**Decentralized where it matters:**

- Publishers advertise terms in standardized `peek.json` manifests
- Publishers enforce policies at their own edge (CDN/Workers)
- Publishers control content transformation and tooling

**Centralized where it helps:**

- Common licensing marketplace handles payments and accounts
- Unified integration path for AI systems across publishers
- Standardized intent-based pricing and contracts

**The result:** AI agents can:

1. **Preview content** to understand value
2. **Choose specific usage types** (read, summarize, embed, etc.)
3. **Pay for actual transformations** rather than raw access

## Key Features

- **üëÅÔ∏è Content Peek** - "Preview" model for informed licensing decisions
- **üéØ Intent-Based Pricing** - Pay for specific transformations (summarize, embed, translate)
- **üîê Unified Licensing** - Single JWT-based system works across all participating publishers
- **‚ö° Edge Enforcement** - Fast, distributed license validation at CDN/edge layer
- **üìä Bilateral Reporting** - Both parties track usage for accuracy and dispute resolution
- **üîß Composable Tooling** - Optional content transformation services

## How It Works

1. **Discovery** - Publishers serve `/.well-known/peek.json` manifests with licensing terms
2. **Preview** - License-gated content returns 203 + content preview + pricing options
3. **License** - AI agents acquire JWT licenses for specific usage contexts from License Server
4. **Access** - Edge enforcers validate assertion-only JWTs and manage budgets locally without
   requiring License Server connectivity
5. **Report** - Both parties report usage asynchronously for billing and dispute resolution

## Why HTTP 203 for Previews?

The specification uses **HTTP 203 "Non-Authoritative Information"** for content previews, which
offers significant advantages over traditional payment walls:

**ü§ñ Better for AI Systems & Crawlers:**

- Most AI systems process 203 responses normally (unlike 402 which is often blocked)
- Search engines and semantic crawlers can index preview content for discovery
- Agents can make informed licensing decisions based on actual content samples
- No need for special error handling - preview content flows through standard pipelines

**üìà Better for Publishers:**

- Higher engagement rates as AI systems actually see and evaluate content
- Natural content discovery through preview snippets appearing in AI responses
- Builds trust through transparency rather than blind payment walls
- Enables value-based pricing decisions (agents see quality before licensing)

**üéØ Semantic Accuracy:**

- 203 correctly indicates "partial information provided" rather than "access denied"
- Previews ARE content (not errors), just not the complete authoritative version
- Aligns with web standards for partial/cached/proxy responses

This approach transforms licensing from a barrier into a **discovery and value demonstration tool**.

## Standard Intents

| Intent       | Purpose                            | Typical Use                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `peek`       | Content preview                    | Discovery, preview                 |
| `read`       | Full content                       | Training, analysis                 |
| `summarize`  | Content summary                    | Context building                   |
| `quote`      | Verbatim excerpts                  | Citations, previews                |
| `embed`      | Vector embeddings                  | RAG, similarity search             |
| `translate`  | Language translation               | Multilingual content               |
| `analyze`    | Structured analysis                | Content classification             |
| `qa`         | Question answering                 | Information extraction             |
| `search`     | Discovery across publisher catalog | Content discovery, filtering       |
| `rag_ingest` | Batch export for RAG systems       | Training data, persistent indexing |

**Note:** `search` and `rag_ingest` operate via dedicated endpoints (not per-URL requests) and work
across multiple resources in a publisher's catalog.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Autonomous Edge Enforcement**: Validates assertion-only JWTs without License Server dependency
- **Decentralized Control**: Publishers maintain authority at their domain edge
- **Centralized Coordination**: Unified licensing and billing across all publishers
- **Bilateral Reporting**: Both parties report usage for accuracy and dispute resolution

## Benefits

### For Publishers

- **Stay in Control** ‚Äî Enforce access policies directly at your domain edge (via Workers/CDNs),
  without ceding content to third-party proxies
- **Simple Monetization** ‚Äî Define pricing once, and rely on a central License Server to manage
  payments and operator accounts
- **AI-Ready by Default** ‚Äî Provide optional transforms (summarization, embed, analyze) so your
  content is consistently represented in AI systems
- **Extend Your Reach** ‚Äî Smaller publishers gain visibility in a shared marketplace, surfacing in
  AI discovery where they might otherwise be missed
- **Brand Integrity** ‚Äî Ensure that when your content is summarized, ingested, or used in AI
  contexts, it reflects your voice and standards
- **Monetize Existing AI Investments** ‚Äî Publishers already create embeddings for on-site
  search/chat; licensed access distributes costs across multiple AI systems
- **Value-Aligned Pricing** ‚Äî Charge based on what agents actually receive (structured data,
  embeddings) rather than arbitrary "page access"

### For AI Systems & Agents

- **Unified Access** ‚Äî Discover participating publishers automatically through `peek.json` manifests
- **One Integration, Many Publishers** ‚Äî Acquire licenses and handle payments centrally, without
  negotiating with thousands of sites individually
- **Lower Compute Costs** ‚Äî Use publisher-provided search, summarization, and transforms to avoid
  expensive, repeated crawling and context building
- **Structured Contracts** ‚Äî Operate within a clear legal and technical framework, reducing risk and
  improving compliance
- **Extensible Tooling** ‚Äî Access publisher-defined tools (via REST or MCP) for specialized use
  cases (training ingestion, semantic search, etc.)
- **Clear Value Pricing** ‚Äî Pay for specific transformations (summarization, embeddings) rather than
  ambiguous "content access"
- **Pre-processed Data** ‚Äî Receive clean, structured data instead of raw HTML parsing and
  transformation

### Economic Win-Win

- **Shared Infrastructure Costs** ‚Äî One embedding computation serves multiple licensed AI agents vs.
  each agent computing separately
- **CPU/Time Savings** ‚Äî AI systems avoid expensive content processing while publishers monetize
  their existing AI infrastructure
- **Access to Publisher Investments** ‚Äî Leverage embeddings and preprocessing publishers already
  create for their own AI features
