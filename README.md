## Overview

**The AI ecosystem is at a crossroads.**  
Publishers want to protect and monetize their content,
while AI systems need contextual, real-time data. This tension has created a patchwork of paywalls,
lawsuits, and closed-door deals.

Peek-Then-Pay provides a better path: an **open standard for balanced collaboration**. Just as HTTP,
HTML, and robots.txt enabled the web to thrive through shared standards, we need consistent rules
for AI content access.

### The Problem: Two Broken Extremes

AI access to web content has polarized into unsustainable models:

1. **Unrestricted scraping** — disregards publisher rights and invites legal and ethical conflict.
2. **Restrictive walls and intermediaries** — from hard paywalls to centralized tollbooths, these block discovery, fragment ecosystems, and concentrate control.

Each side fails to provide a standardized, transparent, and enforceable path for responsible access.  
Publishers need control without isolation; AI systems need access without overreach.

### The Solution: Balanced Hybrid Model

Peek-Then-Pay bridges this gap with **clear separation of responsibilities**:

**Decentralized where it matters:**

- Publishers advertise terms in standardized `peek.json` manifests
- Publishers enforce policies at their own edge (CDN/Workers)
- Publishers control content transformation and tooling

**Centralized where it helps:**

- Common licensing marketplace handles payments and accounts
- Unified integration path for AI systems across publishers
- Standardized intent-based pricing and contracts

**Result:**
AI agents can:

1. **Preview content** to evaluate value
2. **Choose specific usage types** (read, summarize, embed, etc.)
3. **Access clean, context-aware data** — publishers provide accurate transforms that save cost and time

## Key Features

- **👁️ Content Peek** - "Preview" model for informed licensing decisions
- **🎯 Intent-Based Pricing** - Pay for specific transformations (summarize, embed, translate)
- **🔐 Unified Licensing** - Single JWT-based system works across all participating publishers
- **⚡ Edge Enforcement** - Fast, distributed license validation at CDN/edge layer
- **📊 Bilateral Reporting** - Both parties track usage for accuracy and dispute resolution
- **🔧 Composable Tooling** - Optional content transformation services

## How It Works

1. **Discovery** - Publishers serve `/.well-known/peek.json` manifests with licensing terms
2. **Preview** - License-gated content returns 203 + content preview + pricing options
3. **License** - AI agents acquire JWT licenses for specific usage contexts from License Server
4. **Access** - Edge enforcers validate assertion-only JWTs and manage budgets locally without
   requiring License Server connectivity
5. **Report** - Both parties report usage asynchronously for billing and dispute resolution

## Why HTTP 203 for Previews?

The specification uses **HTTP 203 "Non-Authoritative Information"** for content previews, which
offers significant advantages over traditional payment walls:

**🤖 Better for AI Systems & Crawlers:**

- Most AI systems process 203 responses normally (unlike 402 which is often blocked)
- Search engines and semantic crawlers can index preview content for discovery
- Agents can make informed licensing decisions based on actual content samples
- No need for special error handling - preview content flows through standard pipelines

**📈 Better for Publishers:**

- Higher engagement rates as AI systems actually see and evaluate content
- Natural content discovery through preview snippets appearing in AI responses
- Builds trust through transparency rather than blind payment walls
- Enables value-based pricing decisions (agents see quality before licensing)

**🎯 Semantic Accuracy:**

- 203 correctly indicates "partial information provided" rather than "access denied"
- Previews ARE content (not errors), just not the complete authoritative version
- Aligns with web standards for partial/cached/proxy responses

This approach transforms licensing from a barrier into a **discovery and value demonstration tool**.

## Standard Intents

| Intent       | Purpose                            | Typical Use                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `peek`       | Content preview                    | Discovery, preview                 |
| `read`       | Full content                       | Training, analysis                 |
| `summarize`  | Content summary                    | Context building                   |
| `quote`      | Verbatim excerpts                  | Citations, previews                |
| `embed`      | Vector embeddings                  | RAG, similarity search             |
| `translate`  | Language translation               | Multilingual content               |
| `analyze`    | Structured analysis                | Content classification             |
| `qa`         | Question answering                 | Information extraction             |
| `search`     | Discovery across publisher catalog | Content discovery, filtering       |
| `rag_ingest` | Batch export for RAG systems       | Training data, persistent indexing |

**Note:** `search` and `rag_ingest` operate via dedicated endpoints (not per-URL requests) and work
across multiple resources in a publisher's catalog.

- **Autonomous Edge Enforcement**: Validates assertion-only JWTs without License Server dependency
- **Decentralized Control**: Publishers maintain authority at their domain edge
- **Centralized Coordination**: Unified licensing and billing across all publishers

## Benefits

### For Publishers

- **Stay in Control** — Enforce access policies directly at your domain edge (via Workers/CDNs),
  without ceding content to third-party proxies
- **Simple Monetization** — Define pricing once, and rely on a central License Server to manage
  payments and operator accounts
- **AI-Ready by Default** — Provide optional transforms (summarization, embed, analyze) so your
  content is consistently represented in AI systems
- **Extend Your Reach** — Smaller publishers gain visibility in a shared marketplace, surfacing in
  AI discovery where they might otherwise be missed
- **Brand Integrity** — Ensure that when your content is summarized, ingested, or used in AI
  contexts, it reflects your voice and standards
- **Monetize Existing AI Investments** — Publishers already create embeddings for on-site
  search/chat; licensed access distributes costs across multiple AI systems
- **Value-Aligned Pricing** — Charge based on what agents actually receive (structured data,
  embeddings) rather than arbitrary "page access"

### For AI Systems & Agents

- **Unified Access** — Discover participating publishers automatically through `peek.json` manifests
- **One Integration, Many Publishers** — Acquire licenses and handle payments centrally, without
  negotiating with thousands of sites individually
- **Lower Compute Costs** — Use publisher-provided search, summarization, and transforms to avoid
  expensive, repeated crawling and context building
- **Structured Contracts** — Operate within a clear legal and technical framework, reducing risk and
  improving compliance
- **Extensible Tooling** — Access publisher-defined tools (via REST or MCP) for specialized use
  cases (training ingestion, semantic search, etc.)
- **Clear Value Pricing** — Pay for specific transformations (summarization, embeddings) rather than
  ambiguous "content access"
- **Pre-processed Data** — Receive clean, structured data instead of raw HTML parsing and
  transformation

### Economic Win-Win

- **Shared Infrastructure Costs** — One embedding computation serves multiple licensed AI agents vs.
  each agent computing separately
- **CPU/Time Savings** — AI systems avoid expensive content processing while publishers monetize
  their existing AI infrastructure
- **Access to Publisher Investments** — Leverage embeddings and preprocessing publishers already
  create for their own AI features
