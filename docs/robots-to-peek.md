# From robots.txt to peek.json: The Evolution of Web Standards

## The 31-Year Legacy of robots.txt

Since 1994, robots.txt has been the universal standard for website-crawler communication. This
simple text file at `/robots.txt` enabled websites to communicate crawling preferences to search
engines using basic directives:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Allow: /public/
```

robots.txt succeeded because it provided:

- Simple, standardized format
- Universal adoption by crawlers
- Clear communication of website preferences
- Respectful, consensual interaction model

## Why Evolve?

The AI era brings new challenges robots.txt wasn't designed to handle:

- Only binary allow/disallow, no nuanced policies
- No mechanism for fair compensation
- Limited granularity for different use cases
- No technical enforcement—relies on good faith

## peek.json: The Successor for AI Agents

peek.json adapts robots.txt’s principles for the age of AI agents:

| Aspect          | robots.txt (1994)     | peek.json (2025)                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Format**      | Simple text           | Structured JSON                                      |
| **Control**     | Binary allow/disallow | License server manages tool-based access and pricing |
| **Discovery**   | `/robots.txt`         | `/.well-known/peek.json`                             |
| **Enforcement** | Good faith only       | License validation + quotas                          |
| **Use Cases**   | Search crawling       | AI agent content processing                          |
| **Value Model** | Free access           | Fair usage licensing                                 |

## Design Principles for Modern AI

peek.json builds on robots.txt’s success:

- **Standard location** for automatic discovery
- **Machine-readable format** for clear policies
- **Publisher control** over access rules
- **Respectful interaction**—AI agents honor publisher preferences

**Tool support and pricing are managed in the license server and returned via the license API, not
encoded in peek.json.**

And adds modern capabilities:

- **Economic incentives** for fair compensation
- **Granular control** for different AI use cases
- **Technical enforcement** via license validation and usage tracking
- **Flexible implementation** for today’s web infrastructure

## Foundation for the Future

peek.json extends the proven robots.txt model for a new era. Simple, standardized protocols create
sustainable ecosystems—robots.txt did it for search, peek.json does it for AI agents and content
creators. The manifest only points to the license API; all dynamic tool/pricing info is managed in
the SaaS license server.
